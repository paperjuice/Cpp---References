### Description
In here are small snipets of code that will help me refresh knowledge.</br>
</br>

### List of items that need to be added:
* overloaded assignment operator
* linked list
* static list
* WIP: virtual functions + virtual tables 
* virtual destructor
* abstract classes
* aggregation
* concept of slicing
* templates ( variadic as well)
* lambda
* exceptions
* const usage
* algorithm complexity
* unions

### Aggregate 
It has no user-declared constructors, no private nor protected non-static data, no bases and no virtual functions
